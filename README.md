#  Advanced SQL Server Queries on COVID-19 Dataset

This project demonstrates advanced SQL Server queries using COVID-19 data from Our World in Data. It includes data on cases, deaths, testing, and vaccination.

##  Key SQL Concepts Covered
- `JOIN` operations
- `CTE` (Common Table Expressions)
- `Window Functions` for rolling averages
- `Aggregations` and `GROUP BY`
- `NULLIF` and `CAST` handling
- SQL Server-specific syntax (`TOP` instead of `LIMIT`)

##  Tables Used
- `CovidDeaths`
- `CovidVaccinations`

##  Queries Included
1. **Top 10 countries by death rate**
2. **7-day rolling average of new cases**
3. **Top 10 countries by vaccination percentage**
4. **CTE comparing cases to hospital capacity**
5. **Vaccinations vs deaths by continent**

##  How to Use
Just run the `covid_analysis.sql` file in SQL Server with the datasets loaded.

##  Files
- `covid_analysis.sql` – contains all the queries.
- `README.md` – this file.
